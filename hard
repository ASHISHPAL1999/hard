# Step 1: Set ownership to tomcat
chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/logs /usr/local/tomcat/work /usr/local/tomcat/temp

# Step 2: Set restrictive permissions

# Give tomcat user full access (rwx), and no access to group/others
chmod 700 /usr/local/tomcat/logs /usr/local/tomcat/work /usr/local/tomcat/temp

# All files inside: read & write for tomcat only, no access for group/others
find /usr/local/tomcat/logs /usr/local/tomcat/work /usr/local/tomcat/temp -type f -exec chmod 600 {} \;

# All subdirectories inside: full access only for tomcat
find /usr/local/tomcat/logs /usr/local/tomcat/work /usr/local/tomcat/temp -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;

# Step 3: Block deletion of these folders by removing write permission on parent dir
chmod 500 /usr/local/tomcat
